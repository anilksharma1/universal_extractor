"""
HC_Script_STS_ALT_DOB_vF3.py

Merge PII/PHI person records from an Excel export into one row per
confirmed person, for the notification report.

This is a restructured version of the prior merge logic (see
hc_script_old.py / hc_script_unknowns.py for the earlier design). The
pipeline is now built as three sequential phases instead of one flat set of
8 priority levels:

  PHASE 1 - Unknown Name Split (Steps 1-2 of the new spec)
    Any row missing a usable First Name and/or Last Name is pulled OUT of
    the merge pool entirely, before any matching happens, and written to a
    separate "Unknown_Entries" sheet - it is NEVER compared against other
    rows or merged with anything (a name-less/partial-name row is not
    trustworthy enough to identity-match on ID alone in this version). In
    that sheet, whichever of First/Last Name was blank is displayed as
    "[Unknown]" (the other side keeps its real value if it had one); an
    "Unknown Field" column says which side(s) were blank. This is a raw,
    UNMERGED list - rows here are not deduped against each other, so a
    manual reviewer sees every original row untouched.

  PHASE 2 - Name ID Cascade (Step 3 of the new spec)
    Every remaining row (real First AND Last Name) is first partitioned by
    an EXACT normalized (First Name, Last Name) key - two rows can ONLY
    ever end up in the same merged person if they share this exact
    2-field key. Middle Name and Suffix are NOT part of it (see "Middle
    Name / Suffix combining" below) and never block a match either -
    unlike the old script's Middle Name conflict guard, a differing (or
    one-sided blank) Middle Name/Suffix can never keep two rows apart
    anymore. (The exact-match-no-prefix-tolerance behavior for First/Last
    themselves is unchanged from the prior version - see the "Name
    grouping" note below.) WITHIN each such name partition, rows are
    further clustered by 6 strict priority levels, applied in order and
    LOCKED same as the old script's LEVEL_ORDER mechanism (a level's
    groups, once formed, can gain new rows from a later/weaker level but
    can never be bridged into another already-locked group by a later
    level):
        Level 1: SSN                          (Step 3.1)
        Level 2: SSN + DOB                    (Step 3.2)
        Level 3: Driver's License             (Step 3.3)
        Level 4: Passport                     (Step 3.4)
        Level 5: Tax Identification           (Step 3.5)
        Level 6: Government-Issued ID Number  (Step 3.6)
    Since every pair compared already shares the exact same First+Last
    Name, that's no longer part of any level's match test - each level
    only checks the ID evidence itself, plus the same conflict guards as
    before (a genuinely differing DOB blocks a same-SSN match; a
    genuinely differing SSN blocks a same-DOB match).

    ASSUMPTION - per explicit instruction, Middle Name and Suffix no
    longer influence matching AT ALL - not the partition key, not a
    conflict guard. Two rows for the same First+Last Name merge freely
    regardless of Middle Name/Suffix (a blank Middle Name and a filled
    one, or "Jr" vs "Sr", can both merge on a shared SSN). This is a real
    risk: two DIFFERENT people who happen to share an exact First+Last
    Name and some ID evidence will no longer be told apart by a
    genuinely differing Suffix or Middle Name the way either briefly
    could in an earlier version of this script.

    Employee ID, Phone Number, Email Address, and every address field are
    NO LONGER matching criteria in this version (the old script's Rules 4,
    7, 8, 9 are gone) - they are purely APPENDED attributes now (Step 4):
    every value seen across a merged group's rows is kept, semicolon-
    joined, regardless of which level actually matched. Address specifically
    keeps the OLD majority-address / "Other Address" logic (Step 4.1) - see
    split_addresses() - since a blank address should never spin off a
    spurious extra address, and a group can still have have gathered rows
    with 2+ genuinely different real addresses.

    "Tax Identification" (Step 3.5) matches on COL_TAXID ("Tax
    Identification Number"), a real, distinct column in the source data.
    "Government-Issued ID Number" (Step 3.6) matches on COL_GOVID, added
    as its own priority level right after Tax Identification - previously
    an APPEND-ONLY field only (see OTHER_MERGE_COLS); it still doubles as
    one, same as Driver's License/Passport/Tax ID already do.

    A genuinely different real DOB is NEVER allowed to end up in the same
    merged person as a shared SSN - dob_conflict() blocks Step 3.1 outright,
    and every other ID level (3.2-3.6) requires DOB to be matching-or-blank
    (compatible()) - a row with a conflicting real DOB always stays its own
    separate line item. (COL_DOB_ALT / "DOBs" - a formerly-used secondary
    DOB source column - has been removed from this version: it was a data
    error in the source database and is no longer read, matched on, or
    displayed anywhere. COL_DOB is the only DOB source now.)

    Middle Name / Suffix combining (Step 3.2 of the updated spec) - since
    neither is part of the partition key anymore, a merged group can
    genuinely contain different Middle Name/Suffix values, so each is
    resolved differently once a group is built (see main()'s Step 4 and
    _fold_row_into()):
      - Middle Name: the fullest/most complete value seen (same
        fullest_value() logic as First/Last/SSN) - "Max" meaning longest,
        not statistically most frequent.
      - Suffix: the MOST FREQUENT value seen (by normalized comparison),
        ties broken by (1) the fullest raw representation of the tied
        value, then (2) which tied value was seen first - see
        _suffix_tally_from_raw()/_render_suffix_from_tally(). Frequency is
        tracked via a small internal tally carried on every row (never an
        output column) so it stays correct across every later merge stage
        (Step 4's build AND Step 5's non-PII consolidation below), not
        just within one stage.

    ASSUMPTION - Name grouping is an EXACT normalized First+Last Name
    match (no prefix/initial tolerance). If two rows for the same person
    use an initial vs. a full name ("J" vs "Jeffrey"), they will NOT be
    grouped together in this version, unlike the old script's
    name_prefix_compat().

  PHASE 3 - Non-PII Consolidation (Step 5 of the updated spec)
    Once Phase 2 is done, each First+Last Name partition may still hold
    2+ separate output rows (only when nothing bridged them at any of
    the 6 levels). These are split into:
      - FILLED rows: at least one of SSN/DOB/Driver's License/Passport/
        Tax ID/Government-Issued ID Number is populated.
      - BLANK-ID rows: none of those six PII fields are populated (only a
        name, and maybe non-PII attributes - Address/Employee ID/Phone/
        Email/DOCID/other OTHER_MERGE_COLS fields).
    Every BLANK-ID row in a partition is folded together into ONE combined
    row FIRST, regardless of how many FILLED rows exist or how they'll
    eventually be resolved - two blank-ID rows sharing a First+Last Name
    have, by definition, no PII evidence that could conflict, so there's
    no reason to leave several as separate stragglers. That single
    combined row is then folded (its Address/Employee ID/Phone/Email/
    DOCID/etc. appended in) into:
      - the partition's one FILLED row, if there is exactly one;
      - with 2+ FILLED rows, FIRST a filled candidate that shares a REAL
        non-PII attribute with the combined blank row - the EXACT same
        full Address, or an overlapping value in ANY OTHER_MERGE_COLS
        field (Email, Phone, Employee ID, Contact Information,
        Work-Related Information, Data Subject Type, ... - see
        _shares_nonpii_attribute()). If that resolves to EXACTLY one
        candidate, fold there directly - a real shared attribute, not a
        guess, so NOT flagged in "Blank-ID Row Merged (Tie-Break)".
      - only if that's inconclusive (no candidate shares anything, or 2+
        conflictingly do) does it fall back to "the top combined entry":
        the richest FILLED row by ID evidence (most of the 6 fields
        populated), then, if THAT ties too, the one representing the
        MAJORITY of original rows ("Rows Merged") - flagged True in
        "Blank-ID Row Merged (Tie-Break)" this time, since it WAS a
        guess. Only if even this fallback is fully tied (same evidence
        AND same size) is the combined blank row left standing alone and
        reported on the "Ambiguous Name-Group Review" sheet instead of
        guessed at - now a much rarer outcome than before, since the
        evidence/size fallback almost always produces a single winner;
      - nothing further, if the partition has NO filled row at all - the
        combined blank row IS the final row, First+Last Name alone being
        the only evidence there is.
    ASSUMPTION - per explicit instruction, the non-PII attribute sweep
    checks EVERY OTHER_MERGE_COLS field, not just Address/Email/Phone -
    the broadest reading of "Tags, etc.". This carries a real risk: a
    coincidental shared value in a generic, low-information field (e.g.
    the same "Data Subject Type") could link two unrelated people who
    happen to share a name - accepted per explicit instruction, but worth
    knowing about. The Address match specifically is an EXACT normalized
    match only (no blank-tolerant/unit-suffix fuzziness, unlike the
    majority-address clustering in split_addresses()) - per explicit
    instruction.

INPUT  : a CSV file (INPUT_CSV below) with the columns listed in
         EXPECTED_COLS below - every column read and written as plain text
         (dtype=str), so a leading zero in a ZIP/ID or a masked SSN like
         '123-45-XXXX' is never silently reinterpreted as a number.
OUTPUT : ONE workbook (OUTPUT_XLSB below), with the six sheets below each
         as their own tab - written as an intermediate .xlsx (no Python
         library can write .xlsb directly) then converted to .xlsb via
         Excel COM automation, see _write_workbook()/_convert_to_xlsb().
         If that conversion isn't possible (pywin32 not installed, or no
         local Excel install - Windows only), the .xlsx is kept and
         reported as the real output instead - see main().
         - "Merged Notification Data": ONE ROW PER CONFIRMED PERSON
           (known-name rows only - see Unknown_Entries below).
           - First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, and SSN: the single
             fullest/most complete value among the merged rows.
           - Suffix: the single MOST FREQUENT value among the merged rows
             (not fullest - see the Phase 2 "Middle Name / Suffix
             combining" note and _render_suffix_from_tally()).
           - DOB: every distinct real date seen, "; "-joined, formatted
             MM/DD/YYYY (see dob_merge()).
           - Driver's License, Passport Number, Tax Identification Number,
             Government-Issued ID Number, Employee ID: every distinct ID
             token seen, deduplicated and "; "-joined (cells may already
             contain multiple semicolon-joined tokens - see
             parse_id_tokens()).
           - Every OTHER column (DOCIDs, Phone, Email, etc.): every
             distinct value seen, "; "-joined. DOCIDs spills into
             "DOCIDs 2", "DOCIDs 3", ... columns past DOCID_CHUNK_SIZE
             characters (see split_docid_chunks()) - Excel truncates a
             cell past 32,767 characters, so this keeps every DOCID
             intact and visible instead.
           - Address fields: the majority address stays in the normal
             columns (gaps filled from another row's fuller copy of the
             SAME address); every other distinct address goes into "Other
             Address", semicolon-joined (see split_addresses()).
           - "Rows Merged": how many original input rows this became.
           - "Names Differ": True if 2+ raw (pre-normalization) First or
             Last Name spellings were seen in the group.
           - "Blank-ID Row Merged (Tie-Break)": True only for a row that
             absorbed a blank-ID row via the evidence/size FALLBACK (see
             Phase 3) - i.e. no shared non-PII attribute resolved it, so
             it was decided by which filled candidate was richest/biggest
             instead. Worth a quick double-check. Never True for a row
             absorbed via a real shared non-PII attribute (Address/Email/
             Phone/etc. match) - that's not a guess.
         - "Unknown_Entries": every raw row pulled out in Phase 1 (First
           and/or Last Name blank/placeholder) - unmerged, one row each,
           with the blank name side(s) displayed as "[Unknown]".
         - "Junk SSN Review": every row where a non-blank SSN value was
           ignored as unusable (a masked SSN with too few known digits).
         - "Junk DOB Review": every row where a non-blank DOB value failed
           to parse (so it was treated as blank instead of silently
           dropped).
         - "Large Group Review": every merged group with more than 50 rows.
         - "Ambiguous Name-Group Review": every blank-ID row (already
           combined with any sibling blank-ID rows sharing its First+Last
           Name - see Phase 3) that had 2+ filled-row candidates sharing
           no distinguishing non-PII attribute, still tied after both the
           evidence-richness AND majority-size fallback tie-breaks - left
           unmerged (standing alone in Merged Notification Data) rather
           than guessed at. Expected to be rare/usually empty now, since
           the non-PII match and the evidence/size fallback together
           resolve almost every case.

This script does not touch the input file. Save the output only to the
secured/authorized folder for this data (never a desktop) - it contains
SSN, DOB, and other PII/PHI.

Designed for large row counts (uses "blocking" - only compares rows that
already share an exact First+Last Name key AND an exact SSN, DOB, Driver's
License, Passport, Tax ID, or Government-Issued ID Number - instead of
comparing every row to every other row).

    never pandas' batch format INFERENCE. Returns a list the same length as
    raw_series: the 'YYYYMMDD' key for every cell this resolves, or None
    for every cell it doesn't (blank, an Excel serial number, a
    differently-formatted date, malformed/masked, ...) - those still fall
    through to norm_dob() one row at a time, exactly as before.

    WHY NOT JUST VECTORIZE norm_dob() OUTRIGHT: naive vectorization -
    pd.to_datetime(whole_column, errors="coerce") with NO explicit format -
    was tried and rejected. On a column with genuinely mixed date formats,
    pandas infers ONE dominant format for the whole batch and applies it to
    every row, silently returning NaT for any value that doesn't match it -
    even values a scalar, per-value pd.to_datetime() call parses correctly.
    Verified empirically (pandas 3.0.3): '1990-01-01', 'Jan 5, 1985',
    '1985-1-5', '01-05-1985', and '5-Jan-1985' all parse fine one at a
    time, but come back NaT when parsed together in a mixed-format test
    column. Silently turning a real DOB into blank is exactly the failure
    mode the rest of this script goes out of its way to avoid (a blank DOB
    never conflicts, so it can silently bridge two different people
    together during matching) - so this function instead only ever
    resolves a cell against ONE EXPLICIT, hardcoded format, which - unlike
    inference - parses identically whether done one value at a time or as
    a whole-column batch (verified against norm_dob()'s scalar result
    across a battery of unambiguous/ambiguous/invalid test values before
    being trusted here).

    IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: builds the result via an explicit numpy object
    array, not Series.where(parsed.notna(), None) - that was tried first
    and is BUGGY: pandas' .where() does not reliably write a literal Python
    None into an object-dtype Series at masked positions when the value
    already there is pandas' own NaN-like sentinel (which
    parsed.dt.strftime() produces for every NaT row) - it can silently keep
    that pre-existing NaN instead of substituting None. That's a
    correctness trap here specifically: float('nan') is truthy and
    NaN != NaN, so a row that should fall back to norm_dob() (checked via
    `is not None` in build_records()) would instead keep a bogus dob of
    nan, making every such row look like it has a real DOB that conflicts
    with every other blank-DOB row's nan - silently shredding the DOB
    conflict guard for every row this happened to. Explicit numpy
    boolean-mask assignment (below) has no such ambiguity."""

    are finalized: per explicit instruction, DOB must NEVER be displayed as
    a semicolon-joined list of 2+ genuinely different real dates for one
    merged person - if that happens, the rows behind it should never have
    been treated as one person, so they're split back into separate output
    rows (one per distinct DOB) instead of being merged.

    Every Phase 2 match level already guards against this directly
    (dob_conflict() blocks Level 1; every other level requires DOB to be
    matching-or-blank via compatible()), so a group reaching this function
    with 2+ distinct non-blank r.dob values should only happen from a
    data-quality edge case slipping past those guards (e.g. a junk numeric
    value that resolves to two different implausible dates on two
    different rows - see DOB_MIN_YEAR) - this function is the safety net
    for exactly that case, not the primary defense.

    Rows with NO usable DOB at all (r.dob == "") never conflict with
    anything, so they're folded into whichever real-DOB subgroup ends up
    LARGEST (majority) - same tie-break convention already used for
    addresses/suffixes elsewhere in this script - rather than left as their
    own orphan subgroup."""
